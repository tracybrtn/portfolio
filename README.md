## Purpose

### User Story 
* GIVEN as a developer I want potential employers to sample my previous work
  * WHEN I load my portfolio
    * THEN I am presented with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
  * WHEN I check the HTML code
    * THEN it meets accessibility criteria and uses adequate semantics
  * WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    * THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
  * WHEN I click on the link to the section about my work
    * THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications
  * WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    * THEN I am taken to that deployed application
  * WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    * THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
  * WHEN I am presented with my first application
    * THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
  * WHEN I check the website the website tab on my browser
    * THEN I see a favicon with an original design
